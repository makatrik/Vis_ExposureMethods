# Vis_ExposureMethods
Cleaning, wrangling and vizualizing the data of human Exposure methods and tools, using R 

This code is developed to clean, wrangle and vizualize the extracted data undertaken for the ONTOX project Review study that took place in Sysrev web platform for accessible methods and 
tools to assess human exposure. 

A total of 63 mathematical models and toolboxes are identified in the scoping review with 12 of them occurring most frequently to calculate human exposure. The most frequently used mathematical models and toolboxes were associated with exposure route, chemical classes, and input parameters (data) used to estimate exposure. 
The outcome of the combined analysis can guide researchers to select the appropriate mathematical model/toolbox and relatively easily reproduce human exposure estimates calculations for a wide range of environmental chemical classes identified in this scoping review. 
The frequently used mathematical models and tools are designed for different applications and different tiers of exposure assessment and therefore are difficult to group. 
At the same time, considering the diversity of input parameters, the need for further development of exposure models and tools for the inhalation exposure route is shown by our analysis. 
We envision that this scoping review will assist in the harmonisation process of human exposure assessment methods and tools of environmental chemicals in the future.
